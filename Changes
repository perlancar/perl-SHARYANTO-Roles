Revision history for SHARYANTO-Roles

0.70    2014-04-09 (SHARYANTO)

        - Accept pattern like '8 bit' or '24b' for color_depth, for convenience.


0.69    2014-01-23 (SHARYANTO)

        - By default turn off use_box_chars when non-interactive, since most
          pagers includin 'less -R' does not interpret drawing escape codes.


0.68    2013-12-14 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Fix copy-paste mistake.


0.67    2013-12-14 (SHARYANTO)

        - TermAttrs: Add debugging info (in _term_attrs_debug_info) to let user
          know how the attribute values are determined.

        [REMOVED FEATURES]

        - Remove roles I18N, I18NMany, I18NRinci. They are convenient for when
          using Locale::Maketext but I switched all my distributions to using
          Locale::TextDomain this week, so these roles are no longer needed.


0.66    2013-11-12 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Rebuild to fix t/00-compile.t produced by older
          version of DZP::Test::Compile (< 2.033).


0.65    2013-10-10 (SHARYANTO)

        - TermAttrs: Tweak default use_color setting (obey COLOR, or only when
          interactive and color_depth > 0).


0.64    2013-10-10 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Avoid perl undef warning.


0.63    2013-10-06 (SHARYANTO)

        - Replace color_theme_class_prefix from using 'has' to using classic sub
          because it needs to be called as static method too sometimes.


0.62    2013-10-04 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release. Split from SHARYANTO-Utils so deps are lighter.
