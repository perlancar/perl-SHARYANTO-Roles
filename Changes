Revision history for SHARYANTO-Roles

0.66    2013-11-12 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Rebuild to fix t/00-compile.t produced by older
          version of DZP::Test::Compile (< 2.033).


0.65    2013-10-10 (SHARYANTO)

        - TermAttrs: Tweak default use_color setting (obey COLOR, or only when
          interactive and color_depth > 0).


0.64    2013-10-10 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Avoid perl undef warning.


0.63    2013-10-06 (SHARYANTO)

        - Replace color_theme_class_prefix from using 'has' to using classic sub
          because it needs to be called as static method too sometimes.


0.62    2013-10-04 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release. Split from SHARYANTO-Utils so deps are lighter.
